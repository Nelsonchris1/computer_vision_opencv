# computer_vision_opencv

I implemented this code using pycharm and I also used command line arguments

The whole code has been commented because they were written in different segments.

Actual comments were used to segment different filter codes . Actual comment contain 4 “#” . While real codes 
Contain just 1 “#”

All you have to do is uncomment different segment which you want to run.
